# Speed up your store using Advanced Javascript bundling

*Abstract*

By default, Magento javascripts can be delivered by using 
* a. Built-in bundling
* b. Merging all javascripts
* c. No bundling at all. 

These options either improve LCP of the page at the cost of Time to Interactive, or they improve Time to Interactive at cost of LCP. Both result in poor user experience, especially on mobile.  With Advanced javascript bundling,  we will  improve LCP and Time to Interactive. 
 
We will talk about 4 things.

1. Problem with built-in bundling. Problem with no bundling at all (page performance, CDN costs).
2. What is Advanced Javascript bundling and a little history on it ( Manual way , Baler, Magepacksuite).
3. How to integrate advanced  javascript bundling into deployments to gain performance. 
4. We will explore a few more configurations like “Move scripts to bottom”, preloading and prefetch.
